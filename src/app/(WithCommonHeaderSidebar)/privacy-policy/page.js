          As part of a philanthropic initiative, we intend to offer some
          financial assistance to selected Pakistani student(s) to pursue
          post-graduate education in Australia. Our website provides a platform
          for potential candidates to obtain relevant information and to become
          an applicant for possible selection to receive the financial
          assistance being offered. This involves collection and processing of
          personal data of the website visitors and applicants. Additional
          personal data of the student(s) selected to receive the financial
          assistance may also be collected outside of our website by us or our
          affiliates through interviews and/or other forms of verbal/written
          communications.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2 px-7">
          Personal data could also be collected through social media; from
          solicited and unsolicited communications; responses to promotional and
          other materials, among others. If we have your personal data, more
          likely than not, it has been shared with us by you.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2 px-7">
          Additional sources of personal data collection may include the data
          collection technologies incorporated in our website, telecommunication
          systems, digital advertising, social media, etc. In addition to
          personal data that a user of our website voluntarily furnishes, these
          electronic systems may also collect other personal data without the
          knowledge of the user, including user’s preferences, frequency of
          access, IP addresses, type of browser, communication device or
          operating systems used, and geographic location, etc.

          Separately, personal data may also be collected and processed of the

          studies in Australia.

          We collect, store, and process personal data for the purpose of
          implementing our financial assistance scheme, while balancing this
          purpose against the data subject’s interests and fundamental rights.
          To achieve this purpose, we may use various contact management,
          analytics, and processing software and other tools and techniques.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2 px-7">
          We may share personal data with other entities that provide services
          to us, including companies that provide website development &
          maintenance, web analytics, advertising, email distribution, and other
          services. Some of these entities may be located in jurisdictions
          outside of Australia and Pakistan and possibly with a lower level of
          privacy or data protection.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2 px-7">
          We may also process personal data where it is necessary for entering
          into or performing under a contract. Additionally, in certain
          circumstances, we may process personal data based on the consent of
          the data subject for specific purposes.

        <p className="mt-2 px-7">
          We may also use or disclose personal data if the law requires us to do
          so or if we reasonably believe that use or disclosure is necessary to
          protect our rights and/or to comply with judicial or regulatory
          proceedings, a court order or other legal process. We do not otherwise
          disclose or sell any personal data that we collect or which comes into

        <li className="text-2xl font-semibold">Third-Party Activities</li>
        <p className="mt-2 px-7">
          Unaffiliated third parties, such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.,
          are providers of avenues, content, functionality, and services for our
          digital platform(s). We do not control what and how these and other
          third parties collect personal data or how they use it. However, we
          know that in addition to using sophisticated technologies such as
          cookies and web beacons on digital platforms, including websites such
          as ours, third parties routinely employ new and innovative tools,
          techniques, and practices to collect, receive, process, buy, and sell
          personal information over extended durations, build sophisticated user
          profiles, and commercially exploit it. We do not control and are not
          responsible for the privacy and business practices of these third
          parties. Note here that certain of their activities can potentially be
          managed by users themselves, as for instance, through internet browser
          and handheld app controls.

        <li className="text-2xl font-semibold">Children’s Information</li>
        <p className="mt-2 px-7">
          We do not knowingly collect or store personal data of children unless
          permitted by law or provided to us under a contract by the legal
          guardian(s) of the child. If we learn that we have collected
          personally identifiable information of a child without lawful
          authorization, we will delete that information from our database.

        <li className="text-2xl font-semibold">Protecting Personal Data</li>
        <p className="mt-2 px-7">
          We use physical, technical, and administrative measures to protect
          personal data against loss, theft, and unauthorized use, disclosure,
          or modification. We strive to protect the information we maintain;
          however, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information
          that is transmitted to or held by us because data transmission and
          storage are neither error-free nor completely secure.

        <li className="text-2xl font-semibold">Data Retention</li>
        <p className="mt-2 px-7">
          We retain personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the
          purposes for which it was collected and processed, including for the
          purposes of satisfying any contractual, legal, regulatory, accounting,
          or reporting obligations.
